# **App Name**: Expense Tracker Dashboard

## Core Features:

- Selection Boxes: Four selection boxes representing expense status: "To Win", "Winning", "Lost", and "Paid".
- Status-based Expense Counters: Display the quantity of expenses for each selection box based on status.
- Card-based Expense Display: Upon clicking a selection box, display related expenses in card format.
- Detailed Expense Information: Each expense card will present necessary details such as name, value and date.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light green (#A7D1AB) to evoke a fresh and growth-oriented financial vibe.
- Background color: Very light green (#F0FAF2), almost white, creating a calm and clean environment.
- Accent color: Blue (#75A1D0) for interactive elements, providing a stable, reliable feel and good contrast with the primary color.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines, and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Use a grid layout to display the selection boxes, with expenses displayed in a dynamic list of cards when a box is clicked.
- Incorporate financial-related icons within selection boxes to provide visual cues (e.g., a trophy for "To Win", a checkmark for "Paid").
- Subtle animations when toggling selection boxes to confirm to the user when data has changed.
